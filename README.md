# Why did you make this? 
I made this iOS app for my brother's birthday. We played a lot of Pokemon games growing up, so I thought this would be a cool personal gift. Needless to say, he loved it.

# Why isn't this on the app store yet?
I've been submitting it to the app store but I've run into a couple copyright issues. Those are soon-to-be-fixed and it will be on the App Store soon.
